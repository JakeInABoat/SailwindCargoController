Cargo Controller is a mod for the game Sailwind. It provides a simple UI for
managing your cargo in a easier and quicker manner.

Press tab to open your inventory. The cargo controller UI will display in the
top left. Will show your all the (unused) goods on your boat and in the port
staging area if you are close enough. Simply click on a button in the ui to
grab one of those goods.
